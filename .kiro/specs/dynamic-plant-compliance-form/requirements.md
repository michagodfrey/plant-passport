# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a dynamic, real-time plant compliance form that guides users through the process of determining interstate plant movement requirements. The system will intelligently gather user inputs step-by-step, validate commodity types, identify relevant pests, check pest presence by location, and provide comprehensive compliance requirements with clear explanations. The initial implementation focuses on Tasmania as the destination state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user moving plants interstate, I want to enter a commodity name and have the system help me specify the exact type, so that I get accurate compliance information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a commodity name THEN the system SHALL search the commodity table for matching entries
2. IF multiple commodity types exist for the same name THEN the system SHALL present disambiguation options (e.g., "cherry" â†’ "cherry fruits/vegetables" vs "cherry trees/plants")
3. WHEN a user selects a specific commodity type THEN the system SHALL validate the selection against the database
4. IF no matching commodity is found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message with suggestions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with a validated commodity, I want the system to automatically identify relevant pests, so that I understand what biosecurity risks apply to my shipment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a commodity is validated THEN the system SHALL query the commodity_pest table to retrieve all associated pests
2. WHEN pests are found THEN the system SHALL display the pest names and acronyms to the user
3. IF no pests are associated with the commodity THEN the system SHALL inform the user that no specific pest risks are identified
4. WHEN displaying pests THEN the system SHALL show both the pest name and acronym for clarity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who knows the pests affecting my commodity, I want to specify my origin location, so that the system can check if those pests are present in my area.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pests are identified THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to select their origin state
2. WHEN an origin state is selected THEN the system SHALL query pest_state_presence to check which identified pests are present in that state
3. WHEN pest presence is determined THEN the system SHALL display which pests are present vs absent in the origin location
4. IF a pest is zoned in the origin state THEN the system SHALL indicate the zoned status
5. WHEN no pests are present in the origin state THEN the system SHALL inform the user of reduced risk

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with origin and commodity information, I want to specify Tasmania as my destination, so that I can receive specific import requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN origin and pest information is gathered THEN the system SHALL prompt for destination selection
2. WHEN Tasmania is selected as destination THEN the system SHALL query commodity_import_requirement and import_requirement tables
3. WHEN import requirements are found THEN the system SHALL display each requirement with its description
4. IF no specific requirements exist THEN the system SHALL indicate general compliance may still apply

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user completing the compliance check, I want to receive a comprehensive report with an AI-generated summary and detailed requirements, so that I understand exactly what I need to do.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all information is gathered THEN the system SHALL generate a compliance report with an LLM-generated summary paragraph
2. WHEN displaying the compliance results THEN the system SHALL show an AI-generated summary above the detailed requirements that explains the overall compliance situation in plain language
3. WHEN displaying applicable requirements THEN the system SHALL show the requirement name, description, and source regulation below the summary
4. WHEN displaying non-applicable requirements THEN the system SHALL explain why they don't apply (e.g., "pest not present in origin state")
5. WHEN the LLM service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display the detailed requirements without the summary paragraph

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the form, I want real-time validation and guidance, so that I can complete the process efficiently without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering any input THEN the system SHALL provide immediate validation feedback
2. IF an input is invalid THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with correction guidance
3. WHEN moving between form steps THEN the system SHALL maintain previous selections and allow editing
4. WHEN the form is in progress THEN the system SHALL show clear progress indicators
5. IF the system encounters an error THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
