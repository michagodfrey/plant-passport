I.
Dried peas1 that are intended for sowing or animal feed, including grain or seed
mixes must be accompanied by a certificate signed by an approved person stating
that:

(a)
the State or Territory of Australia or of any other country in which the peas
are grown are free of pea weevil (Bruchus pisorum L.); or

(b)
the peas have been fumigated with methyl bromide for 24 hours at
atmospheric pressure according to one of the following rates:

(i)
32 – 40 grams per m3 at 10° - 14°C;
(ii)
24 – 32 grams per m3 at 15° - 20°C;
(iii)
16 – 24 grams per m3 at 21°C or higher; or

(c)
the peas have been fumigated with phosphine in a gas-tight2 structure or
enclosure at the rate of at least 1.5 grams per cubic metre of sealed storage
volume at a temperature of at least 15°C for at least 10 days; or

(d)
The peas have been gamma irradiated at 25 k Gray at an approved facility
using an approved process (applies to peas intended for animal feed only); or

(e)
the peas must be consigned to an approved Level 3 premise within Tasmania
for processing if conditions I (a) or (b) or (c) or (d) are not met (applies to
peas intended for animal feed only).

II.
Other Grains and Seeds that May Contain Peas must:

(a)
contain zero pea seeds per kilogram of grain or seed as indicated by a Seed
Analysis Certificate issued by an accredited laboratory which has examined a
representative sample from the grain or seed lot (Refer IR30 for sampling
protocol detail); or

(b)
if the representative sample of grain or seed contains one or more pea seeds
per kilogram, the lot from which the sample was drawn must be:

(i)
accompanied by a certificate signed by an approved person stating that
the State or Territory of Australia or of the other country in which the
peas were grown is free of Pea Weevil; or

(ii)
fumigated with methyl bromide according to requirement I(b) above; or

(iv)
Gamma irradiated at 25 k Gray according to requirement I(d) above; or

(c)
the grain or seed must be consigned to an approved Level 3 premise within
Tasmania for processing if conditions II(a) or (b) are not met.

that the whole or that part of the State or Territory of Australia or of another
country is free of Pea Weevil.

EXPLANATORY NOTES:
•
1 "Peas" means all varieties of the plants Pisum sativum and Pisum arvense;

•
2 ‘Gas-tight’ means that the storage must meet at least the minimum standard
required, that is a pressure decay from 250 Pa to 125 Pa in five minutes, as
measured by an accepted pressure test.

PROOF:
Consignments must be accompanied by a Plant Health Certificate
