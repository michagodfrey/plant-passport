Biosecurity Matter for the Purpose of Laboratory Analysis or Diagnosis

Any person or Laboratory in Tasmania that is wishing to import some form of
‘biosecurity matter’ (see Section 1.10 – Interpretation for definition) into the State for
the sole purpose of laboratory analytical and diagnostic services, can only do so in
accordance with the following set of import conditions:

SCHEDULE 1 – PLANT MATTER
Plant matter includes but is not limited to fresh or dried:
leaves, stems, petioles, seeds, roots, flowers, other reproductive structures, or callus.

SCHEDULE 2 - SOIL
Soil is defined as the top layer of the Earth, consisting of rock and mineral particulates that may be
mixed with organic matter in which plants grow or are grown.

SCHEDULE 3 – PLANT MATTER EXTRACTS
Plant extracts such as sap, oils, DNA, Reference cultures, including professionally dried/preserved
herbarium specimens.

I.
Approval Requirements
(a)
This Import Requirement only applies to:
(i)
types of biosecurity matter specified in Schedule’s 1 or 2; and
(ii)
biosecurity matter that is being sought to be imported for the sole
purpose of laboratory analysis or diagnosis, that is not being conducted
in the course of an Australian Emergency Plant Pest Response. Separate
and specific import conditions / provisions apply during any such
Emergency Plant Pest Response. These provisions can only be obtained
through direct request to Biosecurity Tasmania.
Please Note: Biosecurity matter specified in Schedule 3 does not need to
meet this Import Requirement.
(b)
Any testing laboratory intending to undertake analysis or diagnosis of plant or
soil material that originates from outside Tasmania must be registered as a
Registered Quarantine Place (RQP; see definition in Section 1.10 of this
Manual) under the Biosecurity Act (Section 70), and are subject to additional
requirements as part of that registration. These requirements include:
traceability, storage, handling, records, security, and a Biosecurity Tasmania
approved treatment of all waste material and residues (e.g. autoclaving) prior
to disposal.
(c)
A record of all samples received including sample type, origin and date
received must be kept and be available for inspection by Biosecurity
Tasmania.
(d)
Where required by interstate authorities, appropriate permits to collect and
export plant or soil samples must be obtained by the laboratory or their client
prior to import, and copies submitted to Biosecurity Tasmania
(e)
If the sample has originated from outside Australia, relevant national
approvals must be obtained and copies submitted to Biosecurity Tasmania
(f)
Material from genetically modified plants or soil containing viable genetically
modified plant material must not be imported unless authorised under
Tasmania’s Genetically Modified Organisms Control Act 2004.
(g)
All aspects of this Import Requirement, and the import conditions that are
required to be applied by the importing party, are subject to audit by
Biosecurity Tasmania.

II.
Sample Size Limits
(a)
Sample sizes are limited to a maximum of 5kg/sample (plant material) and
10kg/sample (soil). Larger sample sizes will be considered subject to at least
48 hours pre-notification of Biosecurity Tasmania and packaging requirements
being met.

III. Packing and Transport of Samples
(a)
Samples must be packed for secure transit with three layers. The first layer
must be contained in suitable air-tight containers and further protected by a
second layer of insulation; e.g. Double bagging using zip-lock bags. The
double-bagged sample must then be placed in a durable outer container as
the third layer.
Alternatively, the guidelines provided in "CRC Plant Biosecurity (2010) How to
send samples for diagnosis in Australia: Plant Disease and Insect
Identification" also satisfy Clause III(a), regarding sample packing and
transport.
However, plastic (weight-rated) Australia Post ‘Express Post Satchels’ are also
considered to be acceptable as the third outer layer as a minimum
requirement for securing the package contents.
(b)
The package must be clearly labelled as follows:
(i)
name and address of the sender (client);
(ii)
clearly state “Imported under Import Requirement 37 - Sample for
Laboratory Analysis”;
(iii)
description of contents (e.g. soil sample for analysis); and
(iv) name and telephone number of a contact person at the testing
laboratory.
(c)
Samples must be sent directly to the testing laboratory.

IV. Seed Imports for Laboratory Analysis
(a)
Seed imported under Import Requirement 37 for laboratory purposes, does
not need to also meet import conditions of Import Requirement 36, so long as
the seed and/or germinated plant material used in experimentation is:
(i)
destroyed securely (such as by autoclave); and
(ii)
not sown in the field.

V.
Breaches
(a)
Any accidents/incidents/or breaches of these conditions must be immediately
reported to Biosecurity Tasmania.
(b)
Failure to comply with any condition above may result in the application of
penalties under the Biosecurity Act, and the suspension of Registered
quarantine place registration.
