Potatoes – Import Conditions

A person must not import, or cause to be imported, any potatoes, except in accordance
with the following:

I.
Imported potatoes or parts of potatoes intended for propagation must be in the
form of tissue culture plantlets or minitubers and meet the requirements detailed in
Explanatory Note 1.

II.
Potato tubers intended for processing or consumption must be free of all other
potato plant parts and washed completely free from soil and other extraneous
matter. The potato tubers will be subject to a barrier inspection by Biosecurity
Tasmania at the port of entry and must be accompanied by a Plant Health
Certificate or Plant Health Assurance Certificate signed by an approved person
stating that:

(a)
The potato tubers were grown in a State or Territory that can demonstrate
freedom from potato cyst nematode (PCN) (Globodera rostochiensis
(Wollenweber) Behrens). [Validation of State or Territory freedom will be on
provision of survey data, the requirements of which are outlined in
Explanatory Note 2. Where such freedom cannot be demonstrated, potatoes
may be imported under the Area Freedom conditions outlined in Clause IV (a)
and (b); and

(b)
The potato tubers were grown in a State or Territory that can demonstrate
freedom from bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al.
(syn. Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith)). [Validation of State or Territory
freedom will be on the provision of survey data, the requirements of which
are outlined in Explanatory Note 3. Where such freedom cannot be
demonstrated, potatoes can be imported under the Area Freedom conditions
outlined in Clause V (a) and (b)]; and

(c)
The potatoes were produced from certified seed (to be accompanied by a Red
Certification Label and PCN Soil Test Certificate if grown in Victoria) which was
grown in a region where PCN and bacterial wilt have not been recorded; and

(d)
The potatoes were produced on a property that does not share agricultural
equipment with any properties in another State, Territory or area unless that
State, Territory or area meets all the conditions of this Import Requirement
for freedom from PCN and bacterial wilt; and

(e)
The potatoes have been packed in clean (free from soil, extraneous matter or
other residues) containers (bags, bins etc).

III. The consignment must be accompanied by a statutory declaration signed by the
grower stating that he/she complies with Clause II (d) above.

IV.
Where State or Territory freedom from PCN cannot be demonstrated as outlined in
Explanatory Note 2, in addition to complying with Clauses II (b) to (e) the following
documentation must be supplied to validate Area Freedom from PCN:

(a)
Complete survey data for PCN from all the potato crops within a defined
growing Area plus a 20 km buffer zone surrounding the Area, covering the 3
years prior to the proposed potato tuber importation. Survey requirements
are outlined in Explanatory Note 2; and

(b)
A PCN soil test from the paddock in which the potatoes were grown,
conducted either pre-planting, during the growing season, or post-harvest
(Explanatory Note 2).

V.
Where State or Territory freedom from bacterial wilt cannot be demonstrated as
outlined in Explanatory Note 3, in addition to complying with Clauses II (a) and (c)
to (e), the following documentation must be supplied to validate Area Freedom
from bacterial wilt:

(a)
Complete survey data for bacterial wilt from all the solanaceous crops within a
defined growing Area plus a 20 km buffer zone surrounding the Area, covering
the 3 years prior to the proposed potato tuber importation. Survey
requirements are outlined in Explanatory Note 3; and

(b)
A soil test for bacterial wilt from the paddock in which the potatoes were
grown, conducted either pre-planting, during the growing season, or post-
harvest.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 1: Importation of potatoes for propagation

•
Tissue culture: Sterile potato plantlets produced at a ViCSPA accredited tissue
culture laboratory and accompanied by a copy of the Certificate of Accreditation; or
as released from a Post-entry Quarantine facility.

•
Minitubers: ‘Generation 0’ material (minitubers, microtubers etc) produced at a
ViCSPA accredited facility and accompanied by a Black Certification Label indicating
material variety and generation and a copy of the Certificate of Accreditation of the
minituber facility that produced it; or as released from a Post-entry Quarantine
facility.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 2: Survey requirements for PCN.

In order to demonstrate State or Territory Area Freedom from PCN, the following
information is required:

(a)
A survey of all of the potato crops in the defined Area for which freedom from PCN
is being claimed must have been completed over the 3-year period prior to the
proposed importation. The survey should also encompass a 20km buffer
surrounding the Area. One third or greater of the crops in the Area must be
surveyed each year. Survey information must be accompanied by a map detailing
the Area for which freedom from PCN is being claimed. If freedom from PCN is to
be claimed, survey data must indicate no cases of PCN within the Area or the buffer
zone over the 3-year period.

(b)
The National protocol for soil sampling and testing for PCN must be followed (Hinch, 1991. National sampling strategies and standards for detection of potato cyst
nematode. In: Potato Cyst Nematode- Impact on Australian Horticulture and a
Proposed National Strategy). Horticultural Policy Council Industry Report No 6,
1993, pp 127-131).

The minimum acceptable sampling intensity under this protocol is deemed to be the
collection of 200 x 10cm3 samples on a 10 x 10m grid pattern for every 2 hectares,
providing a combined 2kg field sample from which a 500g sub sample of dried soil
is processed.

In order to declare freedom from PCN, no cysts will have been found in any of the
samples over the entire three-year period of testing.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 3: Survey requirements for bacterial wilt.

In order to demonstrate State or Territory Area Freedom from bacterial wilt, the following
information is required:

(a)
A visual survey of all solanaceous crops within the defined Area for which freedom
from bacterial wilt is being claimed will have been completed over the 3-year period
prior to the proposed importation. The visual survey should also encompass a 20km
buffer surrounding the Area. One third or greater of the crops in the Area must be
surveyed each year. Any suspect plants will have been serologically tested for
bacterial wilt. Survey information must be accompanied by a map detailing the Area
for which freedom from bacterial wilt is being claimed. If freedom from bacterial
wilt is to be claimed, survey data must indicate no cases of bacterial wilt within the
Area or the buffer zone over the 3-year period. Specimens suspected of infection
with R. solanacearum must be laboratory tested for the presence of the bacterium.

PROOF:
Consignments must be accompanied by a Plant Health Certificate
