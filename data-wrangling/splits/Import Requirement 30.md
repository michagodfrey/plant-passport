Grain and Grain Products Intended for Animal Feed - Import Conditions

NOTE: THIS IMPORT REQUIREMENT IS ONE OF SEVERAL THAT MUST BE SATISFIED
WHEN IMPORTING GRAIN OR SEED INTO TASMANIA FOR USE AS ANIMAL FEED 1.
IMPORTERS SHOULD ALSO REFER TO RELEVANT PARTS OF IMPORT REQUIREMENTS 12,
22, 27, & 32. CERTIFICATION MUST BE PRESENTED 24 HOURS PRIOR TO
CONSIGNMENTS ARRIVING, OTHERWISE THE CONSIGNMENT WILL NOT BE
PROCESSED WITHIN 24 HOURS OF CERTIFICATION RECEIVAL.

Entry to Tasmania of grain or grain products including or derived from cereals, oilseeds
and other seeds and, intended for use as livestock, bird, pet or other animal feed is
regulated under this Import Requirement.

Tasmania’s system for managing weed, pest and disease risks in grain imported for use
as animal feed is based upon matching the risk status of that grain with the ability of
Tasmanian premises to manage it. Grain is graded into one of four grades as described in
Annex 1. Approved premises levels and requirements are described in ANNEX 2.
Imported feed grain suppliers and users should read ANNEX 1 and ANNEX 2 to determine
how the import requirements listed below apply.

Please Note: Biosecurity Tasmania inspectors will only release imported grain to
receiving premises in Tasmania that are approved to receive that particular grade of
grain.

I.
Certification
The following documents must be provided to Biosecurity Tasmania 24 hours prior
to import and are required for each lot of grain in a consignment. A lot is a quantity
of a single type of grain, identifiable by reference to a line of bags, sacks, storage
bins, or silo, container or hold number.

(a)
Tasmanian Feed Grain Grade 1 (TF1) destined for Level 1 Premises:

(i)
A Notice of Intention to Import Grain/Seed (see forms online at:
https://nre.tas.gov.au/biosecurity-tasmania/biosecurity/biosecurity-
forms ); and

(ii)
A declaration or certificate stating the lot of grain to which it applies
was:

•
packed in new, clean, empty bags; or

•
loaded into containers that were inspected and found to be clean and
free of soil, contaminants and residues of previous cargo; or

•
loaded into ships’ holds that were inspected and found to be clean and
free of soil, other contaminants and residues of previous cargo; and

1 As defined under Section 1.10 – Interpretation, the current list of declared weeds, pests and diseases can be
found online at the Tasmanian Biosecurity Compendium website.

(iii)
Documents relevant to sampling and testing2:

•
a Seed Analysis Certificate or a Seed Analysis Statement issued by a
laboratory that has International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) or
National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) accreditation, for each
lot of grain in the consignment; and

•
If multiple consignments of seed belonging to a lot that has been
certified free of declared weed seeds are proposed for import, copies of
the Statement of Seed Analysis may be submitted for up to 24 months
from the date of issue; and

•
a Statutory Declaration completed by the supplier that adequately
identifies the lot to which the Seed Analysis Certificate or Statement
relates and, states that the sample submitted for analysis was drawn
only from that lot.

OR

•
certificates issued by an appropriate authority or other documents
showing the grain has been treated or processed such that all declared
weeds, pests and diseases are rendered non-viable will be considered by
Biosecurity Tasmania in place of other documents listed in Clause I
(a)(iii). Clauses I (a)(i) and I (a)(ii) must still be met. Except in the case
of documents indicating the lot has been treated according to Clause III
of this Import Requirement, Biosecurity Tasmania cannot guarantee
documents relating to treatment or processing will be considered in time
to facilitate a particular import if the supplier does not provide them well
ahead of the import.

(b)
Tasmanian Feed Grain Grade 2 (TF2) destined for Level 2 Premises:

(i)
As for Clauses I (a)(i) and I (a)(ii); and

(ii)
As for Clause I(a)(iii), except that the Seed Analysis Certificate or
Statement need not cover declared weed seeds but must cover other
relevant declared pests and diseases, and soil content levels.

(c)
Tasmanian Feed Grain Grade 3 (TF3) destined for Level 3 Premises:

(i)
As for Clause I (a)(i).

(d)
Tasmanian Feed Grain Grade 4 (TF4) destined for Level 1, 2 or 3
Premises:
(i)
As for Clauses I (a)(i) and I (a)(ii); and
(ii)
Must be processed in a manner approved by Biosecurity Tasmania 3.

2 PLEASE NOTE: Grain that arrives at the barrier without the required documents will be held. The grain may,
at the supplier’s cost, be sent for processing at a Level 3 premise, or deep buried, or returned to the exporter.
Biosecurity Tasmania will determine which of these options apply, in consultation with the supplier and/or
importer.
3 Approvals are assessed via ‘Application for Approval of Treatment of TF4 Grain (IR30)’ which can be found at
www.nre.tas.gov.au/biosecurity-tasmania

II.
Sampling and Testing
TF3 or TF4 grain is not required to be sampled and tested for declared weeds, pests
and diseases prior to entry to Tasmania. However, TF1 and TF2 grain destined for
Level 1 or Level 2 premises respectively must be sampled and tested, as
appropriate.
A representative sample of each lot of TF1 or TF2 grain must be obtained according
to:

(a)
Primary samples from bulk grain:

Primary samples from bulk grain transported in shipping containers or ships’
hold must be taken at a minimum rate of 2.25L per 33.3 tonnes in one of the
following ways:

(i)
By manually drawing grain from the conveyer belt at loading into
containers or ships’ holds, as close to the valve of the cell as practicable
using, at random intervals, a 0.25L dipper until the whole lot has been
sampled; or

(ii)
Using an approved in-line automatic sampler to sample the whole lot at
loading into containers or ships’ holds; or

(iii)
Using a Biosecurity Tasmania approved sampler to draw samples from
holding bins or silos immediately prior to loading for transport to
Tasmania; or

(iv) By any other Biosecurity Tasmania approved sampling method.

(b)
Primary samples from bagged grain:
Primary samples from bagged grain must be drawn using a suitable trier and
ensuring samples are taken from the top, middle and lower parts of each
sampled bag. The sampling rate for bagged grain is:

(i)
1 primary sample from each bag for lots of 1 to 5 bags; or

(ii)
1 primary sample from at least every third bag and not less than 5 bags
for lots of 6 to 30 bags; or

(iii)
1 primary sample from at least every fifth bag and not less than 10 bags
for lots of 31 bags or more.

(c)
Composite samples:
Primary samples obtained according to Clauses II (a) or II (b) must be
transferred to clean containers and thoroughly mixed to ensure the resulting
composite sample is homogenous.

(d)
Submitted samples:
The composite sample for a lot of grain must be sub-sampled to obtain a
sample for testing. The sample submitted for testing must:

(i)
weigh at least 2 kg for lots up to 100 tonnes; or

(ii)
weigh at least 5 kg for lots greater than 100 tonnes; or

(iii)
be of another weight approved by Biosecurity Tasmania.

(e)
Testing Specifications:
The submitted TF1 or TF2 sample must be searched according to ISTA rules
for the following (unless otherwise stated): and, depending on whether the
grain is destined for Level 1 or Level 2 premises:
(i)
seeds of weeds declared as Restricted matter (applies to TF1 only); and
(ii)
seeds of lupin (Lupinus spp.), chickpea (Cicer spp.), canola (Brassica
napus), pea (Pisum spp.); and
(iii)
seeds of ryegrass (Lolium spp.), which must be inspected for ryegrass
nematode (Anguina spp) galls; and
(iv) the soil content, in the ‘inert matter’ of the seed analysis certificate,
must not exceed more than 0.1% by weight of the sample submitted for
testing.

(f)
Sample Description:
The Seed Analysis Certificate or statement issued by the laboratory is to
adequately describe the sample and must state, as appropriate:
(i)
the presence or absence of all declared weed seeds; and
(ii)
the presence or absence of lupin, chickpea, pea seeds and canola
(forage brassica varieties are exempt from IR32 requirements, and
varietal names must be cited in NOI’s and/or certificates); and
(iii)
the presence or absence of ryegrass nematode galls; and
(iv) the presence and percentage of soil content; and
(v)
the presence and percentage of inert matter.

(g)
Validation Sampling and Testing:
Biosecurity Tasmania inspectors or approved persons under biosecurity
authorisation undertake random sampling of imported TF1, and TF2 grain
consignments. Samples are analysed at the NRE Tas Seed Laboratory and if
there are discrepancies between results obtained by that laboratory and test
certificates provided by the supplier, the grain will be classified according to
the findings of the NRE Tas laboratory. Random sampling and verification of
TF4 grain may be undertaken to test viability of processed product. Charges
will be raised for this validation sampling, testing and, any other subsequent
actions deemed necessary by Biosecurity Tasmania including increased
targeted intervention of subsequent imports. TF3 grain is not subject to
validation sampling and testing but is subject to verification inspection at the
discretion of Biosecurity Tasmania inspectors. Suppliers seeking further detail
about these procedures should contact Biosecurity Tasmania.

III. Treatment
(a)
Suppliers of grain lots which have been gamma irradiated to 25 k Gray or
treated by any other method of treatment approved by Biosecurity Tasmania
(this relates to treatments that do not change the form of raw product) need
not comply with Clause I (a)(iii) or Clause II. This grain will be graded as TF1
once a copy of a treatment certificate is presented to Biosecurity Tasmania
(as detailed in Clause I (a)(iii) point 5).
OR
(b)
Ethylene oxide fumigation is an approved method of treatment for bird seed
under an initial minimum vacuum of 50 kilopascals at:
(i)
1500g/m3 for 4 hours at 50°C; or

# Page 5

Plant Biosecurity Manual Tasmania
2024 Edition – Version 1
113
(ii)
1500g/m3 for 24 hours at 21°C.

IV.
Transport to Tasmania
Bulk TF1 or TF2 grain that is not covered by a Plant Health Certificate or Plant
Health Assurance Certificate must be transported to Tasmania in containers that
facilitate validation sampling on arrival via the top of the container by Biosecurity
Tasmania, as required. Bulk TF3 or TF4 grain is not required to be transported in
containers with top access.

V.
Transport within Tasmania
All imported grain must be transported in a manner that provides load security and
prevents spillage in transit to the receiving premises. All containers, bags, vehicles,
trailers or augers must be cleaned at the intended discharge point or at an
approved premise prior to and after each use. All spillages must be reported as
soon as reasonably possible and cleaned up immediately.

ANNEX 1 - Feed Grain Gradings

Tasmanian Feed Grain Grade 1 (TF1)
TF1 feed grain has been sampled and tested and found free of all declared weeds, pests
and diseases, or if containing Seeds with Specific Conditions (see IR36) has certification
that these seeds are free of declared pests or diseases, as applicable. Any contaminating
soil must not be more than 0.1% by weight of the sample submitted for testing. TF1 feed
grain may be stored and used at any premises including private households (e.g. feed for
“backyard” laying hens).

Tasmanian Feed Grain Grade 2 (TF2)
TF2 feed grain may contain seeds of declared weeds but no Seeds with Specific
Conditions (i.e. peas, chickpeas, lupins, ryegrass; see IR36, Clause II(a & c)), or if
containing Seeds with Specific Conditions, has certification that these seeds are free of
declared pests or diseases, as applicable. Any contaminating soil must not be more than
0.1% by weight of the sample submitted for testing. The grain must be milled or
processed in such a way that risks posed by any of these contaminants are reduced to
levels equivalent to TF1 feed grain. This grain may only be stored and used at Level 2
and 3 premises.

Tasmanian Feed Grain Grade 3 (TF3)
TF3 is grain that contains or may contain seeds of declared weeds, trace amounts of soil
and/or ryegrass nematode and/or pea weevil and/or uncertified lupins and/or uncertified
chickpeas. This grain must be consigned to an approved premise that has been approved
to receive this category of product. The grain must be processed such that risks posed by
any of these contaminants are reduced to levels equivalent to TF1 before it is released to
end-users. This grain may only be stored and used at Level 3 premises prior to
processing. After processing it can be used at any premise including private households
(e.g. feed for “backyard” laying hens).

Tasmanian Feed Grain Grade 4 (TF4)
TF4 is grain containing or that may contain seeds of declared weeds, trace amounts of
soil, ryegrass nematode, pea weevil, uncertified lupins or uncertified chickpeas that has
been processed in a manner that renders the risk of any contaminants or viable declared
weed seeds negligible and pea weevil, ryegrass nematode, lupin anthracnose, and
chickpea blight negligible. This grade of grain must have been processed prior to export
to Tasmania at a facility applying a treatment approved by Biosecurity Tasmania as
having the procedures and processes in place to produce TF4-grade grain but excludes
devitalisation treatments such as gamma irradiation or other treatments that do not
change raw product form (TF3 standard or better performed offshore of Tasmania). This
grain may be stored and used at any premise including private households (e.g. feed for
“backyard” laying hens).

- Management Requirements

•
The management requirements (and grain grade allocations) form the basis of a system designed to improve post entry weed risk
management of imported feed grain. The system also has a premise approval procedure that is linked to the Biosecurity Act.

•
Level 2 and Level 3 premises will be approved and audited by Biosecurity Tasmania, or its approved representative. The management
requirements outlined above will form the basis of conditions of accreditation for Level 2 and Level 3 premises. Biosecurity Tasmania may
also authorise or require practices and procedures in addition to those listed, as appropriate. Surveillance checks on these premises may
occur at any time.

•
Level 1 premises are not required to be approved or audited for their capacity to manage weed risk. Adherence to the listed management
requirements for Level 1 is the responsibility of the premise owner and will not be monitored by any external party. Level 1 premises found
to have received unprocessed TF2 or TF3 will be in breach of the Act.

DEFINITIONS:

1. Grain Grades: TF1, TF2, TF3 + TF4.
   See Import Requirement 30 - Annex 1 for a description of these gradings.

2. Premises:
   Level 1: Farm users are any premise, large or small, that uses or handles imported feed grain in an open environment
   (paddocks, yards etc). These will typically be farms (including commercial, hobby and part-time).

Level 2: Intensive feeding systems, Feedlots and/or Housed facilities are premises in which animals are fed in and
restricted to a confined and designated area (e.g. permanent feedlot, pig and poultry sheds), but excludes pre-live
shipment feeding facilities.

Level 3: Commercial millers and processors are premises concerned with the milling or processing of imported feed grain
that can meet the conditions for approval to handle and process TF3 grade imported grain.

3. Transport:
   Refers to all forms of transport (road, rail, sea and air) and includes onto and within premises/properties

DISCLAIMER: Through the application of Import Requirement 30, Biosecurity Tasmania does not intend nor claim to certify the
quality for animal feeding purposes of any consignment or lot of feed grain imported into Tasmania. Ensuring that any
consignment or lot of feed grain is of the necessary quality for their animals is the responsibility of the grower/owner or their
agents.
