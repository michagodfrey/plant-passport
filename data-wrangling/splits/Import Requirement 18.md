Other States and Territories of Australia:
Host plants of fire blight (E. amylovora) listed in Schedule 1 may be imported into
Tasmania from another State of Australia in which the disease fire blight exists or has
been known to exist under the following conditions:

I.
Plants and plant products, other than fruit, of a genus of plants in the host list that
have been grown in or consigned from a location within twenty (20) kilometres of
the site of a confirmed detection of E. amylovora that is under active quarantine
control are permitted entry to Tasmania under the following conditions:

(a)
they have been grown in a nursery that has been certified by the Department
of Agriculture or equivalent organisation in the State or Territory in which the
nursery is located, as being:

(i)
located more than ten (10) kilometres from the infected site(s); and

(ii)
inspected by an approved person in the previous spring and autumn and
no evidence of E. amylovora was found;

and

(b)
they are accompanied by a Plant Health Assurance Certificate that the plants
were grown on that nursery for the previous twelve (12) months.

II.
Fruit of a genus of plants in the list below that were grown within five (5)
kilometres of the infected site(s) is not permitted entry to Tasmania.

III. The acceptance of these conditions by Tasmania is conditional on the establishment
and policing of a quarantine area, by any State/Territory where fire blight has been
detected, which prevents the movement of host plants or plant products (other
than fruit) out of the 0 to 10 kilometre zone and fruit of host plants out of the 0 to
5 kilometre zone to other parts of that State.

PROOF:
Consignments must be accompanied by a Plant Health Certificate
