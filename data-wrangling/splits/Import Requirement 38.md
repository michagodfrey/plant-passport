38
Nursery Stock

This Import Requirement (IR 38) provides five options for people who wish to bring or
send nursery stock into Tasmania. Nursery stock means plants in soil-less potting
media, bulbs, corms and rhizomes, and bare-rooted plants or cuttings (including
budwood and scionwood), with or without leaves. It does not include plant tissue
cultures, cut flowers, seeds or bagged or bulk potting media. Separate conditions and
restrictions apply to those items. Prospective importers should consult other parts of this
manual as relevant, or confirm conditions and restrictions with Biosecurity Tasmania’s
Biosecurity Operations Branch. In summary, the five options are:
IR38 A - specifies in part a chemical treatment regime that reflects ICA – 29 (Treatment
of Nursery Stock and Soil-less Media). Under IR38A, pest risk is primarily managed prior
to export. Use of IR38A is subject to certification by interstate biosecurity officials, or
certification by ICA -29 accredited businesses.
IR38B – specifies conditions based on the Greenlife Industry Australia (GIA) standards
for biosecurity which underpin the Nursery Industry Accreditation Scheme, Australia
(NIASA). Under IR38B, pest risk is managed prior to export and in Tasmania, at around
the same level. Use of IR38B is subject to Biosecurity Tasmania assessment, approval
and audit of Tasmanian importers and mainland suppliers.
IR38C – This IR is revoked from 19th December 2012.
IR38D – recognises that individual nursery stock importers in Tasmania or mainland
suppliers may propose ways of managing pest risk to a level equivalent to that achieved
by the other three options. Use of IR38D is subject to Biosecurity Tasmania assessment,
approval and, potentially, audit of Tasmanian importers and/or mainland suppliers.
IR38E – specifies conditions based on the Greenlife Industry Australia (GIA) BioSecure
HACCP program. Under IR38E, pest risk management is undertaken prior to export to
Tasmania by a business certified under the BioSecure HACCP scheme and found
competent in, and authorised to apply, a relevant Entry Condition Compliance Procedure
(ECCP). Use of IR38E is subject to certification by BioSecure HACCP certified businesses.
Importers need only meet one of the four options for any particular type of nursery
stock. However, consignments may be comprised of several types of nursery stock that
meet different options, provided import documents show the specific option with which
each type of nursery stock complies. Importers must comply with IR 38 AND other IRs in
this manual that apply to specific pests of nursery stock, and any other relevant
conditions and restrictions currently in effect for plants and plant products. Annex 1
outlines the relation between IR 38, other IRs, and other current conditions and
restrictions for plants and plant products. Biosecurity Tasmania and interstate biosecurity
authorities maintain the right to inspect certified nursery stock at any time, and to refuse
to accept it if it does not meet all relevant conditions and restrictions, or if import
documents do not clearly indicate the nursery stock meets those conditions and
restrictions. Chemical use permits referred to in this Import Requirement are permits
issued by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. It is the user’s
responsibility to ensure any chemical treatment specified in or otherwise part of any
Import Requirement option, is undertaken in accord with relevant federal and state
legislation for chemical registration and safe use. Biosecurity Tasmania, NRE Tas accepts
no liability for any loss or damage resulting from chemical treatment applied for the
purpose of this Import Requirement.
