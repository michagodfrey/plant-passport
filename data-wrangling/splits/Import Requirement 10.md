EXPLANATORY NOTES:
1 “Phylloxera Exclusion Zone (PEZ)” means a whole State or part thereof, recognised
to be free from Grape Phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae). To acquire a PEZ
status, a region must have been established by historical information and/or a
survey program as not being infested by grape phylloxera and be protected by
appropriate legislation to control the movement of grape phylloxera host produce
including grapevine material, specified grape products and vineyard equipment into
the area.
2 “Phylloxera Risk Zone (PRZ)” means an area not defined as a PEZ or PIZ, where the
grape phylloxera status is unknown.
3 “Phylloxera Infested Zone (PIZ)” means an area containing grape vines known to
be infested with grape phylloxera or have been infested with grape phylloxera.
4 “Rootlings” means bare-rooted cuttings grown on to develop roots
5 “ICA-37” means ‘Interstate Certification Assurance Scheme document number 37 –
Hot Water Treatment of Grapevines’
6 “Approved Source” means a source approved by Biosecurity Tasmania
7 “ICA-33” means ‘Interstate Certification Assurance Scheme document number 33 –
Movement of Wine Grapes’

bitumen. Excludes earth surfaces.

skins, seeds and possibly some stems.

Area or Property Freedom

Please Note:
•
Consignments that meet ICA-2317 and/or PHY0218 satisfy any condition of this
Import Requirement where area or property freedom from grape phylloxera is
required.

•
Table grapes treated with Methyl bromide fumigation for both grape phylloxera and
fruit fly (see Import Requirement 2) may use the dosage rate of 32 g/m3 at ≥21°C
fruit-core-temperature OR 40 g/m3 between 17°C-20.9°C fruit-core-temperature.
This will satisfy methyl bromide treatment requirements for fruit fly (Queensland
fruit fly and Mediterranean fruit fly) as well as for grape phylloxera.

•
In selected circumstances, alternative fumigation treatments may exist in relation
to the use of carbon dioxide or sulphur dioxide as referred to in Section 2.8.

PROOF:
Consignments must be accompanied by a Plant Health Certificate or a
Plant Health Assurance Certificate
