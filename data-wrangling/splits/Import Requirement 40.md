European House Borer - Vectors

A person must not import, or cause to be imported from Western Australia, any material1
derived from hosts of European house borer (Hylotrupes bajulus), these being coniferous
trees including Pinus species (pines), Abies species (firs), Picea species (spruces),
Araucaria species, or Pseudotsuga species (oregon), except in accord with the following:

I.
TREATMENT
Host material must be either:
(a)
Subject to insecticidal preservative treatment effective against European
House Borer either by vacuum pressure impregnation, dipping or spraying in
compliance with Australian Standard for Preservative Treatments of Timber
(AS 1604); or
(b)
Heated to achieve a core temperature of 56°C and held at that temperature
for at least 30 minutes; or
(c)
Fumigated with methyl bromide2, at normal atmospheric pressure, with
fumigation monitored at 2, 4, 12 and 24 hours and the minimum
concentration for those periods maintained, in accord with Table 1;
AND
(d)
After treatment as specified in either Clause I(a), I(b), or I(c), the material
must be stored and handled in a manner that minimises potential for
infestation or re-infestation with European House Borer.

(a)
Pine pallets, other than new pine pallets, must be sourced from a supplier
accredited under an approved pallet quality assurance scheme;

OR

III. PEST FREE AREA
Host material must originate from European House Borer Free Area, and be stored
and handled in a manner that minimises potential for infestation or re-infestation
with European House Borer.

EXPLANATORY NOTES:
•
1Material means sawn softwood timber, pine dunnage, commercial lots of pine
firewood, and pine pallets, excluding pallets made from heartwood;
Products made from processed pine, and pine furniture, artefacts, craft materials or
household effects are not subject to this Import Requirement;
•
2Host material subject to methyl bromide fumigation must have at least one physical
dimension less than 200mm thick.
