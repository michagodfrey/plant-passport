Fruit Fly Host Produce - Disinfestation with Methyl Bromide

A person must not import, or cause to be imported, any fruit of a plant listed in Schedule
1A of the Plant Biosecurity Manual Tasmania (the Manual) unless:

I.
It has been fumigated with methyl bromide for two hours at one of the following
rates for:

(a)
Queensland fruit fly (see Explanatory Note 1);

Methyl Bromide (g/m3)
Fruit Core Temperature (°C)
32
21+
40
17 - 20.9

or
(b)
Mediterranean fruit fly (see Explanatory Note 2);

Methyl Bromide (g/m3)
Fruit Core Temperature (°C)
32
21+
40
16 - 20.9
48
11-15.9
56
10-10.9

and
(c)
Fruit core temperature must be verified in accordance with the following:
i)
The temperature must be measured by placing the tip of the
temperature probe into the centre of a piece of fruit located in the
middle of a carton;
ii)
At least three temperature readings must be taken from each bin or
pallet or lot on each pallet.

1.  Where the lot is on a pallet, at least three different cartons in a lot
    must be inspected, including samples taken from:
    a.
    One from the top of the pallet;
    b.
    One from the centre/inside/middle of the pallet; and
2.  Where the lot is in a bin, at least three different samples readings
    must be taken from each bin, including samples taken from:
    a.
    One from the top of the bin;
    b.
    One from the centre/inside/middle of the bin; and
    iii)
    In addition to three readings specified in Clause I(c)(ii) above, a further
    three readings must be taken for each commodity in the pallet, lot on a
    pallet or bin that is either a different fruit variety or supplied by a
    different grower and/or packer.

and

II.
Fumigant loading rates for fruits and vegetables are not less than 30%, nor more
than 50%, of the volume of the chamber when empty;

and
III. The fumigator ensures produce packaged or covered with impervious materials
(such as plastic bags, stacked plastic punnets or waxed paper), are opened, cut or
removed to allow adequate penetration of the gas unless impervious materials
contain:
(a)
not less than four unobstructed perforations of 6mm diameter per 100cm2; or
(b)
five unobstructed perforations of 5mm diameter per 100cm2; or
(c)
numerous pinholes (at least 6 holes per square centimetre).

and
IV.
The fumigator ensures the ambient air temperature within the fumigation chamber
is monitored and maintained at the minimum temperature specified in Clause I(a)
or I(b) for the relevant dosage to be applied, ensuring that:
(a)
ambient air temperature recording instruments in the chamber are located in
a position that does not receive direct airflow from the circulation fans and
heating element. The sensor must be located in an area either behind the
circulation fans or an area in which the air passing the sensor is returning to
the fans (i.e. return air monitoring); and
(b)
temperature recordings are taken every thirty minutes during the fumigation.

and
V.
A pre-treatment fruit fly inspection must occur per chamber load for all notified fruit
fly high risk products (see Explanatory Note 3):
(a)
The inspection must be undertaken by an Authorised Inspection Person
trained in the identification of fruit fly and signs of fruit fly infestation; and
(b)
For each type of produce a separate 600 unit inspection must be completed
ensuring an even distribution of fruit is inspected proportionate across all
varieties and growers and/or packers represented in the chamber load for
each product type; and
(c)
Any fruit showing signs of fruit fly infestation must be cut and examined for
presence of fruit fly; and
(d)
The Authorised Inspection Person endorses that the fruit is free of live fruit
fly; and
(e)
All fruit of the same variety, sourced from the same grower and/or packer
confirmed to have live fruit fly does not qualify for treatment and those
packages must be rejected; and
(f)
All other produce from the same grower and/or packer of the non-conforming
lot must be rejected for treatment for that day, excluding already treated
produce.

and
VI.
The Plant Health Certificate or Plant Health Assurance Certificate must clearly
indicate the chamber room number for each lot in the consignment (all fruit fly host
produce):

(a)
Where the whole consignment has been fumigated in the one chamber room,
the words ‘Chamber Room #XX’ can be written in the ‘Additional
certification/Codes’ section, where XX references the unique chamber room
number assigned to that specific chamber; and
(b)
Where the consignment has been fumigated in multiple chamber rooms, a
chamber room number must be written next to each lot certified; and
(c)
Where the same chamber room has been used for multiple fumigation
treatments on the same day, the chamber room number and time of
fumigation must be written next to each lot certified.

EXPLANATORY NOTES:
1 For mango fruit (Mangifera indica), this import requirement applies in respect of
Mediterranean fruit fly only. Methyl bromide fumigation for Queensland fruit fly in mango
fruit is no longer accepted as of 21 February 2024.
2 For plums (all varieties), this import requirement applies in respect of Mediterranean
fruit fly only from 22 March 2024. Methyl bromide fumigation for Queensland fruit fly in
plums is no longer accepted as of 22 March 2024.
3 A list of ‘fruit fly high risk products’ can be found on Biosecurity Tasmania’s web page
(see High Risk Products - Import Requirement 2 | Department of Natural Resources and
Environment Tasmania (nre.tas.gov.au)). Re Clause V, pre-treatment fruit fly inspection
is not required between 1 April and 30 September each year.

•
This Import Requirement applies in respect of Queensland fruit fly and Mediterranean
fruit fly;
•
All methyl bromide fumigation must be carried out by a licensed fumigator in an
approved chamber;
•
Consignments that meet Interstate Certification Assurance (ICA) protocol ICA-04
version 4.0 (Fumigation with Methyl Bromide) satisfy this Import Requirement so long
as the fumigation procedure accounts for all conditions of this Import Requirement;
•
Treated fruit may be allowed to ventilate adequately for the minimum practical period
(as per label use requirements) after fumigation prior to securing as per Schedule 1B;
•
The provisions of Schedule 1B for secure handling, storage and transport (as specified
in the Manual) override the provisions in ICA-04 for post treatment security for
Tasmania;
•
Alternative fumigant treatment options may also exist, as referred in Section 2.8 of
the Manual.

PROOF: Consignments must be accompanied by a Plant Health Certificate or a
Plant Health Assurance Certificate
