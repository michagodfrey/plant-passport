A person must not import, or cause to be imported, any plant or plant product that is a
host (Schedule 1) of onion smut (Urocystis cepulae Frost), and Iris Yellow Spot Virus
(IYSV), except in accordance with the following:

Schedule 1: Hosts of Onion Smut and IYSV
Allium spp. bulbs of, but not limited to, all edible cultivars (or species) of onion, leek,
spring onion, shallot, chive and garlic. Bulbs for human consumption are exempt for IYSV
and for onion smut, provided Clause II(b) is met. Peeled or processed garlic is exempt.

I.
All commodities (Schedule 1) – Whole-of-State/Territory Area Freedom:
Host plants or plant products must be accompanied by a certificate signed by an
approved person stating that the plant or produce was grown and/or packed in a
State or Territory for which there is a valid area freedom certificate for both onion
smut and IYSV.

II.
All commodities (Schedule 1) – Partial State/Territory Area Freedom:
(a)
Allium spp. bulbs for mother plants (bulbs for propagation) and transplants1
cannot be imported into Tasmania unless:
i.
the imported bulbs are free of thrips species;
and
ii.
they have been certified free of onion smut and IYSV by an approved
seed production program;
or

1.  they are accompanied by a certificate to verify that the crop was
    inspected by an approved person (Qualified Government Officer
    with plant pathogen expertise) prior to bulb formation and again
    prior to the onset of leaf senescence and found free of onion smut
    and IYSV; and
2.  that no plants are known to be infected by onion smut and IYSV
    within a 10km radius of the site where the crop was produced.

(b)
Allium spp. ‘bulbs for human consumption’ that are grown in Australia may be
imported into Tasmania.

III. Agricultural equipment from any State where onion smut is known to occur must be
accompanied by a certificate signed by an approved person stating that the
equipment has not been used within 3km of the location of any outbreak of onion
smut. Such equipment must also satisfy IR39, and be free of plant detritus of any
form, and require chlorine-based treatment for machinery out of any State where
onion smut is known to occur.

same requirements as that required for ‘bulbs for mother plants’, as specified in
Section II of IR11.
