Agricultural Equipment, Machinery and Vehicles (New and Used)

A person must not import, or cause to be imported, any agricultural equipment1 or
machinery2, or vehicle3 except in accordance with the following:

I.
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
(a)
The agricultural equipment, machinery or vehicle must be thoroughly cleaned
prior to arrival to ensure it is free of any restricted matter4, including soil,
plants, seeds or other plant material, debris or any other thing that may
harbour a pest or disease agent; and
(b)
The agricultural equipment, machinery or vehicle must meet all other relevant
Import Requirements in this Manual and may be accompanied by either a
certificate or other declaration detailing pre-shipment procedures such as
cleaning, (or other treatment as considered necessary) 5.

EXPLANATORY NOTES:
•
Any agricultural equipment or machinery entering Tasmania that does not comply
with Clause I(a) and I(b):
(i)
will be directed for cleaning, (or other treatment as considered necessary), at
a place and in a manner approved by Biosecurity Tasmania; (a substantial
amount of dismantling may be required to prove no pockets of restricted
matter, soil, etc, remain hidden); or
(ii)
if satisfactory treatment is not possible, the contaminated agricultural
equipment or machinery will be re-exported.
•
All costs associated with cleaning or re-export will be the responsibility of the
importer.
•
A Cleaning Checklist is provided to serve as a guide to assist in the cleaning of a
grain harvester. The numbered sections listed in the Cleaning Checklist correspond
to the numbers in the diagrams of a Rotary Harvester and a Conventional
Harvester. These represent contamination “hot spots”, which must be found to be
clean of all restricted matter on inspection.
1 Agricultural equipment means any equipment or vehicle used for the culture,
harvesting, packing or processing of any plant or plant product.
2 Machinery means any type of machinery or equipment, agricultural or non-agricultural,
which may be contaminated with restricted matter of any form.

rowers that cut and windrow the crop prior to harvest.
