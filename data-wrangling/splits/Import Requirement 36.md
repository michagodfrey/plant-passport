Seeds for Sowing

A person must not import, or cause to be imported, any viable seed, except in
accordance with the following:

EXPLANATORY NOTE:
This Import Requirement does not apply to viable seed intended for use as animal feed
(e.g. livestock feed grain, or birdseed). Refer to Import Requirement 30 of this Manual
for relevant conditions and restrictions.

CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

I.
CERTIFICATES
The following certificates must be provided with the NoI, as relevant.

(a)
STATEMENT OF SEED ANALYSIS
A Statement of Seed Analysis is required for seed lots1 of more than 1kg, and
must refer to the following:

Declared Weed Seeds (see definition in Section 1.10 – Interpretation)
(i)
A representative sample of the seed lot must be tested by a laboratory
accredited by the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) or
another accrediting body approved by the NRE Tas, for declared weed
species (declared weed species are listed in the Tasmanian Biosecurity
Compendium online); and

(ii)
The Statement of Seed Analysis issued by an ISTA accredited laboratory
or equivalent must indicate zero declared weed seeds in a sample drawn
from the seed lot; and

(iii)
If a lot of seed consists of mixed species or varieties, a Statement of
Seed Analysis that relates to a sample drawn from the mixed lot, or
separate Statements of Seed Analysis for each sub-lot of species or
varieties that comprise the lot, must be supplied;

AND

Seeds with Specific Conditions
(iv) The statement of Seed Analysis must specify all necessary information
on the presence or absence of any ‘Seeds with Specific Conditions’ as
listed in Table 1 (see Clause I(c) below).
If the Statement of Seed Analysis also pertains to a type of seed that is
subject to other pest or disease Import Requirements set out in this
Manual (i.e. it is a Seed with Specific Conditions), or lists such a seed as
‘other seed’, the lot must also satisfy the relevant Import
Requirement/s. These Import Requirements and the Seeds with Specific
Conditions to which they apply are listed in Table 1 below.

AND

Soil and Stones
(v)
The soil content, in the ‘inert matter’ of the seed analysis certificate,
must not exceed more than 0.1% by weight of the sample submitted for
testing; and

(vi) Seed for sowing containing stones as contaminants is permitted entry
provided the stones are free of soil, and the Statement of Seed Analysis
meets I (a)(v).

AND

Ryegrass nematode (Anguina agrostis)
(vii) The Statement of Seed Analysis for seed of ryegrass (Lolium) species
must state that the sample has been searched for ryegrass nematode
(Anguina agrostis) galls, and that zero galls were detected; and

(viii) If Lolium seeds are present as contaminants of other seed, the
Statement of Seed Analysis must state that the Lolium seeds were
searched for ryegrass nematode galls, and that zero galls were
detected;
or

(ix) Alternatively, an importer may provide a certificate issued by an
appropriate state or country authority indicating the area in which the
seed was grown is free of ryegrass nematode.

AND
Representative Sample
(x)
The Statement of Seed Analysis must indicate that the sample was
drawn by an appropriately accredited person by identifying the
statement as ‘official’, or by quoting the accredited sampler’s licence
number, or equivalent.

AND
Statement of Seed Analysis Valid Period

(xi) If multiple consignments of seed belonging to a lot that has been
certified for import into Tasmania are proposed for import, copies of the
Statement of Seed Analysis may be submitted for up to a maximum
period of 24 months from the date of issue, otherwise the Statement of
Seed Analysis will be considered to be invalid.

(b) SMALL WEIGHT SEED IMPORTS2
A Statement of Seed Analysis may be submitted but is not required for
individual imports of 1 kg or less per variety if that seed is:

(i)
not a declared weed, prohibited plant or seed, or restricted seed; and
(ii)
not being imported for the purposes of research3; and
(iii)
not intended to be consolidated into a larger quantity of the same seed
in Tasmania;
AND

(iv)
from a supplier (a business or other organisation) on the list of
Tasmanian Approved Seed Suppliers (TASS)4;
or
(v)
imported by an importer on the list of Tasmanian Approved Seed
Importers (TASI)5, 6.
or
(vi)
If Clause I(b)(iv) or I(b)(v) are not satisfied, conditions listed in Clause
I(a) apply (i.e. a Statement of Seed Analysis must be supplied).

(c)
REQUIREMENTS FOR ‘SEEDS WITH SPECIFIC CONDITIONS’ 7

Some seeds must meet conditions and restrictions for pests and diseases of
biosecurity significance to Tasmania, set out in other Import Requirements in
this Manual. Seeds with Specific Conditions and the relevant Import
Requirements are listed in Table 1.

II.
SEED FOR PROCESSING IN TASMANIA

(a)
Importers must apply to Biosecurity Tasmania for an Individual Permit prior to
import of seed intended for extraction from pods, capsules, fleshy fruit or
other reproductive structures, cleaning, coating, treatment or other
processing.

III. NO GENETICALLY MODIFIED SEED

(a)
Viable genetically modified seed of any species must not be imported to
Tasmania unless authorised under the Genetically Modified Organisms Control
Act 2004.

IV.
IMPORTED SEED CONSIGNMENT CONDITION AND LABELLING

(a)
All imported seed consignments must be contained in outer packaging that is
clean and in good repair such that seed spillage does not occur.
AND

(b)
Consignments containing more than 1kg of seed must comply with Clause
V(b) and be labelled with:
(i)
name and address of the supplier and of the consignee; and
(ii)
weight and lot number matching individual packages to the relevant
Statement/s of Seed Analysis, in compliance with Clause I(a).
OR

(c)
Consignments containing 1 kg of seed or less must be labelled with seed
botanical name, name and address of the supplier and of the consignee, and
comply with Clause V(b).
AND

(d)
When consignments contain more than one line of seed or mixed seed, ALL
species must be identified, consistent with Clauses IV(b) or IV(c).

V.
IMPORTED SEED INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

(a)
All seed must be presented to Biosecurity Tasmania on arrival.

(b)
Seed imported by air or sea freight or using Australia Post services must be
presented for inspection by addressing to the consignee, and marked for the
‘Attention of Biosecurity Tasmania’.

(c)
Seed carried on a person or in personal baggage accompanying a person
entering Tasmania must be presented to Biosecurity Tasmania at the
permitted point of entry.

VI.
NATIONAL SEED IMPORT REQUIREMENTS

(a)
Seed imported into Tasmania that originates from overseas must also meet
national import requirements administered by the Commonwealth Department
of Agriculture and described on the national Biosecurity Import Conditions
system database (BICON) at https://www.agriculture.gov.au/import/online-
services/bicon.

VII. IMPORTATION OF SEED GROWN IN TASMANIA

(a)
If certificates of analysis are supplied with the seed lots and the parameters
(inert matter, declared weeds) on the analysis certificate meet import
requirements, no additional certification or testing is required. Tasmanian
seed that has been certified in Tasmania is considered to meet ryegrass
nematode and inert matter requirements.

(b)
Where blended seed lots are involved a separate certificate is required for
each of the seed lots making up the blend.

(c)
Seed certificates must be completed in full. Where certification details are not
completed, entry of the seed is not allowed until such certification details are
supplied or alternative arrangements are made with Biosecurity Tasmania. In
situations where certification is incomplete e.g. no certification for one
component of a blend, then entry certification is considered incomplete and
entry will not be allowed.

EXPLANATORY NOTES:
1 A seed lot is a quantity of a single type of seed, physically identifiable by reference to a
line of packages, sacks, storage bin or silo number(s), container number(s) or hold
number(s) of a ship, and for which a Seed Analysis Certificate/Statement can be
issued.
2 The arrangements for seed imports of 1kg or less DO NOT obviate the need to comply
with other IRs, where applicable.
3 Small weight seed imports of 1kg or less for trial or research purposes must be
imported using an Individual Permit.

4 Biosecurity Tasmania maintains a list of Tasmanian Approved Seed Suppliers (TASS).
These businesses or other organisations are approved to distribute seed in small
quantities based on production practices, quality control systems or other protocols
that are assessed by Biosecurity Tasmania as having met the State’s Appropriate
Level of Protection (ALOP) with regards to biosecurity risk posed by seeds of
declared weeds, pests and diseases if entering Tasmania.
5 Biosecurity Tasmania also maintains a list of Tasmanian Approved Seed Importers
(TASI) who import seed lots of 1kg or less from sources that are not on the TASS
list These businesses, organisations or individuals have been assessed and are
recognised as having the ability and means to examine seed for identity,
homogeneity, seed condition and presence of material of potential Biosecurity
concern in a way that meets ALOP for seed.
6 Enquiries about becoming an Approved Seed Supplier or an Approved Seed Importer
can be made to Biosecurity Tasmania
7 Re Clause I(c), please note that the import requirements specified for Seeds with
Specific Conditions apply to all seed imports, including lots of 1 kg or less.
